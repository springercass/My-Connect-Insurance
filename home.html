            <h2>Homeowner's Insurance</h2>
            <p>
              Accidents can happen, even at home. If someone were to claim an
              injury on your property, there’s no stopping them from affecting
              your finances, your house, or anything else you own that can be
              labeled as compensation. As the property owner, you could be held
              fully responsible for injuries to others that occur due to
              hazardous conditions such as poor lighting, floor hazards, or
              falls resulting from snow or ice. With a Homeowners Liability
              policy from TW Group, Inc., you can ensure the security of your
              finances and the safety of your family in the event of an
              accident. For serious injuries, including casualties, you may be
              responsible for paying large medical bills and even court costs if
              you are sued. This policy works to protect you in a variety of
              situations, including: Claims for property damage Claims for
              injury to others (either on or off the premises) Liability defense
              costs Medical expenses for injuries to others Having the proper
              Homeowners Liability Insurance for your home will prepare you for
              future accidents and help preserve your hard-earned assets and
              finances. Talk with a representative from TW Group, Inc. to
              determine the right amount of coverage to keep you protected
              today.

            <h2>Condo Insurance</h2>
            <p>
              For many, a condo is a great alternative to living in an apartment
              or a home, and can offer more space, more living area, and more
              amenities. But since a condo is a special kind of residence, it
              requires its own insurance policy. With Condo Insurance from TW
              Group, Inc., you can extend your protection past that of what your
              condo community provides. It helps pay for the replacement of your
              personal belongings while offering basic liability to cover bodily
              injury or property damage. And unlike Renters Insurance, Condo
              Owners Insurance covers any damage done to the interior of your
              unit. For any interior damage, your insurance may be used to pay
              for the expense of fixing or replacing items like drywall,
              flooring, light fixtures, and more. A Condominium Insurance policy
              includes other great features like guest medical protection, which
              pays for the medical expenses of friends and visitors who are
              injured on your property. In the event a fire or other disaster
              puts your condo out of commission, additional living expenses
              coverage may reimburse you for cost of temporary housing while
              your unit is being fixed. Contact a specialist at TW Group, Inc.
              today to determine the right amount of coverage you need to keep
              your condo insured.

            <h2>Renter's Insurance</h2>
            <p>
              If you rent an apartment, house, condo, or even a dorm room, you
              may not think you need insurance. But in the event that fire,
              theft, or vandalism damages your property, it’s unlikely that your
              landlord will pay to replace your belongings. At TW Group, Inc.,
              we know that you’ve most likely invested a lot of time and money
              in your personal property, and it’s up to you to take care of it.
              Having a Renters Insurance, or Tenants Insurance, policy can pay
              for the cost of replacing your belongings if they are damaged due
              to a covered accident, or if they’re stolen. Depending on your
              policy, your insurance will pay to replace items using one of two
              methods: Actual Cash Value (ACV) or Replacement Cost. With ACV
              coverage, your belongings are insured only for the amount in which
              they are currently worth, while Replacement Cost will pay for the
              expense of replacing the items with brand new ones.

            <h2>Mobile Home Insurance</h2>
            <p>
              At TW Group, Inc., we know you’ve worked hard to turn your mobile
              home into the perfect living space for you and your family, but
              sometimes accidents like fire or severe storms can cause major
              setbacks. That’s why we’re committed to serving all of your
              insurance needs. With a specialized Mobile Home Insurance policy,
              you can safeguard your home and your belongings in the event of a
              covered loss. Mobile Home Insurance works much like a typical
              Homeowners policy and typically includes features such as:
              Personal Property Protection to pay for loss or damage to most of
              your personal items Family Liability Protection to provide legal
              representation against injury or property damage claims Guest
              Medical Protection to help cover the medical expenses for visitors
              injured in your home Home & Structure Protection to compensate you
              for building repairs after a covered accident Additional Living
              Expenses to reimburse you for temporary housing during
              reconstruction Additional Benefits for Your Mobile Home We know
              how special your mobile or manufactured home is to you, and we’re
              proud to offer to an exceptional insurance policy that’s designed
              to meet your budget. You may also qualify for extra savings and
              discounts simply by having extra security devices installed in
              your home, or by combining your Mobile Home and Auto Insurance
              policies. Talk with an insurance specialist at TW Group, Inc. to
              learn how you can save with Mobile Home Insurance.
