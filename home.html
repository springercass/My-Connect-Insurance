            <h2><i class="fas fa-building"></i>Condo Insurance</h2>
            <p>
              Condo Insurance helps pay for the replacement of your personal
              belongings while offering basic liability to cover bodily injury
              or property damage. Unlike Renters Insurance, Condo Owners
              Insurance covers any damage done to the interior of your unit and
              will cover fixing or replacing items like drywall, flooring, light
              fixtures, and more. In the event that a fire or other major
              disaster renders your condo unliveable, your condo insurance may
              reimburse you for cost of temporary housing while your unit is
              being fixed.

            <p>
              If you rent an apartment, house, condo, or even a dorm room, you
              may not think you need insurance, it’s unlikely that your landlord
              will pay to replace your belongings in the event of a fire, theft
              or other incident that results in the loss of your property. Even
              as a renter, you want to protect your hard earned property and
              having a Renters Insurance, policy can pay for the cost of
              replacing your belongings if they are damaged due to a covered
              accident, or if they’re stolen. We help you find a policy that
              will not only cover the value of your lost items but also any
              charges associated with having them set up or delivered.

              other attached structures from a fire, natural disaster, damage
              caused by tenants, medical payments in the event of injury and
              Legal counsel and fees in the event you are sued or face a related
