            <h2>Commercial General Liability</h2>
            <p>
              With every business comes major risks, and you don't want to lose
              your hard earned revenue or even lose your business because of an
              accident. As a business owner, you aren't just responsible for
              ensuring that operations are running smoothly, but also keeping
              your employees and property insured from injuries and damage. We

              to your business' needs. Commercial General Liability can reduce
              or even prevent major financial loss if your business is sued or
              held legally responsible in the event of bodily injury or damage
              and can cover most medical expenses, attorney fees, settlements,
              and reimbursements covered.
