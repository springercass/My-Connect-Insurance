            <h2>Commercial General Liability</h2>
            <p>
              Running a business is a major responsibility that can involve many
              risks. Not only are you responsible for ensuring that your
              day-to-day operations run smoothly, but you’re also accountable
              for keeping your employees and property insured from injuries and
              damages. At TW Group, Inc., we can help you create a policy that’s
              designed to safeguard the best interests of your business - so you
              can focus on serving your customers and increasing your profits.
              Commercial General Liability from TW Group, Inc. can prevent major
              financial losses if your business is sued or held legally
              responsible in the event of bodily injury or damage. With the

            <h2>Commercial Property</h2>
            <p>
              Every day, you work hard to ensure that your business stays up and
              running. From serving your customers and offering your products
              and services to providing your employees with jobs, your business
              is a powerhouse of activity. That’s why it’s important to make
              sure your commercial property is protected because accidents do
              happen, and the last thing you want to experience as a business
              owner is being out of commission and under the wrong policy. With
              a custom Property Insurance policy from TW Group, Inc., you can
              ensure that the building itself and the personal property of your
              business is protected from minor accidents or a major financial
              loss. Our insurance specialists can help you create a policy that
              keeps your small-to medium-size business insured from top to
              bottom by covering such items as: Your building All interior items
              (desks, furniture, etc.) Any outdoor signs on your property
              On-site equipment Your inventory Other items that are typically
              found on a Property Insurance policy can include Builder’s Risk
              insurance and Equipment Breakdown coverage. Builder’s Risk
              protects any materials or equipment from damage or loss sustained
              during construction or remodeling, while Equipment Breakdown, or
              Boiler and Machinery, keeps any electrical, electronic, or
              pressurized equipment on your premises insured from breakdowns or
              loss.

            <h2>Workers Compensation</h2>
            <p>
              TW Group, Inc. understands the value of good employees. We know
              that your day-to-day operations depend on their hard work,
              expertise, and dedication, and if you supply them with quality
              benefits and plans, they can work with the peace of mind assurance
              that they’re properly protected. But should an accident happen,
              having the right Workers Compensation plan from TW Group, Inc. can
              allow your business to ensure payments and cover expenses if an
              employee is injured from a work-related accident. Injuries can
              range from car accidents and back injuries to equipment
              malfunctions and, in some unfortunate cases, death. Workers
              Compensation can cover financial obligations such as: An injured
              employee’s medical expenses/treatment The replacement of lost
              wages from injury time off If your business does not offer Workers
              Compensation, serious injuries that occur on the job could lead to
              an employee suing your company for damages. That’s why it’s
              important to discuss your options with a specialist at TW Group,
              Inc. who can help you find the right coverage options for all your
              business needs.
