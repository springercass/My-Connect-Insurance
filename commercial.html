            <h2>Commercial General Liability</h2>
            <p>
              With every business comes major risks, and you don't want to lose
              your hard earned revenue or even lose your business because of an
              accident. As a business owner, you aren't just responsible for
              ensuring that operations are running smoothly, but also keeping
              your employees and property insured from injuries and damage. We
              at Connect Insurance Group help you design a policy that tailored
              to your business' needs. Commercial General Liability can reduce
              or even prevent major financial loss if your business is sued or
              held legally responsible in the event of bodily injury or damage
              and can cover most medical expenses, attorney fees, settlements,
              and reimbursements covered.

              Accidents can and will happen, and the last thing you want as a

              protects any materials or equipment from damage or loss sustained
              during construction or remodeling, or
              <span class="underlineP"> Equipment Breakdown coverage</span>,
              which covers items like Machinery, electronics, or pressurized
              equipment from breakdowns or loss.
