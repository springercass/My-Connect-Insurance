            <h2>Liability Coverage</h2>
            <p>
              If an accident occurs, you're going to want to have the right
              insurance to cover yourself personally, legally and financially.
              Liability Coverage, will protect you if you’re held responsible
              for an accident by having medical payments available for injuries
              sustained to you or the other driver, passengers, and pedestrians,
              as well as any bills for property damage or legal fees.
            </p>

            <br />
            <p class="boldP">
              Auto liability coverage has two main parts: Bodily Injury and
              Property Damage Liability
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              <span class="underlineP">Bodily Injury Liability</span>
              helps pay for costs associated with the other person’s injuries,
              which includes medical expenses, pain and suffering and loss of
              revenue from time spent out of work. <br /><span
                class="underlineP"
                >Property Damage Liability</span
              >
              handles expenses that come from damage to another driver’s vehicle
              or property. If the accident is very serious, Liability Coverage
              will reduce the risk of major loss from expenses that could result
              in the loss of your home, savings, and income.
            </p>

            <h2>Collision Coverage</h2>
            <p>
              For a lot of people, their car is a big investment and if you get
              into an accident, you want to make sure that you protect that
              investment. Whether the damage is a result of an accident with
              another vehicle or an object, you want that damage to be covered
              by our insurance. The right amount of Collision Coverage depends
              on factors like the age and year of your car, as well as your
              financial situation and we at Connect Insurance Group can help you
              find the best coverage that works for you and your unique
              situation. You may also want to add-on Diminishing Deductible, GAP
              Coverage, and Accident Forgiveness to your plan for better
              protection.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              <span class="underlineP">Diminishing Deductible</span> rewards
              safe drivers with a discount and can even eliminate the deductible
              that they pay if they were to get into an accident.
            </p>
            <p>
              <span class="underlineP">GAP Coverage</span> covers the difference
              when a settlement from an accident is less than the actual amount
              you owe on your vehicle loan. We will make sure that you get paid
              enough to cover what you still owe on your cars financing or
              leasing agreement.
            </p>

            <p>
              <span class="underlineP">Accident Forgiveness</span> ensures that
              your rates won’t increase just because of a single accident.
