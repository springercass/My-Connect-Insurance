              If an accident occurs, you're going to want to have the right
              insurance to cover yourself personally, legally and financially.
              Liability Coverage will protect you if you’re held responsible for
              an accident by having medical payments available for injuries
              sustained to you or the other driver, passengers, and pedestrians,
              as well as any bills for property damage or legal fees.

              Liability Coverage will protect you if you’re held responsible for
              an accident by having medical payments available for injuries
              sustained to you or the other driver, passengers, and pedestrians,
              as well as any bills for property damage or legal fees. Auto
              liability coverage has two main parts:
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li>
                Bodily Injury Liability helps pay for costs associated with the
                other person’s injuries, which includes medical expenses, pain
                and suffering and loss of revenue from time spent out of work.
              </li>
              <li>
                Property Damage Liability handles expenses that come from damage
                to another driver’s vehicle or property. If the accident is very
                serious, Liability Coverage will reduce the risk of major loss
                from expenses that could result in the loss of your home,
                savings, and income.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              For a lot of people, their car is a big investment and if an
              accident happens, you want to make sure that you protect that
              investment. The right amount of Collision Coverage depends on
              factors like the year of your car, etc., and we at Connect
              Insurance Group can find the best coverage that works for you.
              Some add ons to consider include:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Diminishing Deductible -rewards safe drivers with a discount and
                can even eliminate the deductible that they pay if they were to
                get into an accident.
              </li>

              <li>
                GAP Coverage -covers the difference when a settlement from an
                accident is less than the actual amount you owe on your vehicle
                loan. We will make sure that you get paid enough to cover what
                you still owe on your cars financing or leasing agreement.
              </li>

              <li>
                Accident Forgiveness -ensures that your rates won’t increase
                just because of a single accident.
              </li>
